Log:
Keep a running log - Contain the action and the term number

Messages routed locally by the simulator - using src and dst
Must have: src, dst, leader (ID, FFFF if unknown), type
type can be modified for own messages - just need get, put, redirect
respond with ok - if key not present, just return empty

Need a way to convert log to state

When receiving a PUT
if Follower: redirect to leader
if Candidate: ??
if Leader: Add to log - keep uncommitted - send to followers - wait until have a majority to commit - get enough OKs:
commit, tell replicas to commit (LOG replication)

Leader election:

If a node goes offline - keep tracking it

Only vote or replicas with >= term, log at least as up to date

5 second delay before client requests are received
 - if requests received during an election - queue up - redirect if follower,
